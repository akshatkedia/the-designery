The unique home and lifestyle products that have emerged from The Designery are primarily based on themes of Time and Light. They have been described as having “ethnic flair with an edgy, contemporary twist”. These commissioned pieces lead us into explorations of the relationship between inanimate object and human life. This is how we unleash our creativity and connect to people in novel ways.
