In every area of contemporary life, human experience is being significantly shaped by design. The Designery is a multi-disciplinary graphic label that specializes in innovative design and visual communication. Our approach challenges conventional design standards where we combine our craft of unique story-telling and conceptualizing with a mastery of design technique.
We believe in story-telling our brand experiences through design. Our design process involves weaving a signature brand story after identifying the core essence of your business. We lend fresh perspectives and flesh out highly design-led solutions to accelerate growth for both you and your brand. Our creative mastery comes mainly from having a deeply empathetic focus on user needs and realizing the perfect balance between organic inspiration and design that matches global standards.
The Designeryâ€™s exhaustively detailed, boundary-breaking and metaphor-making approach delivers nothing short of very high quality work right from the initial creative brief to the final execution.

The embodiment of The Designery, founder Nikita Mehta Shah reveres design as more than an art form. Her decade's worth of experience in the industry has seen her work featured in Good Homes, Better Interiors and Kyoorius Magazines, to name a few. Having worked with RMG David, Umbrella Design, Breeze Design Studio, Santoro Graphics, Grandmother India & her timely stints at Landor Mumbai, this artist launched The Designery circa 2012. She has, ever since, worked with brands like The Taj, Asian Paints, J.W. Marriott, ABIL, Tara Jewels and Godrej among many others. Her inspired passion for design is illustrated in every project she takes up, approached with sensitive skill and professional artistry.
