Branding for 'BIRCH' : A menswear brand. The branding revolved around The concept of 'Perfection of Geometry' which is all about symmetry and balance in design. The birch visual identity needed to exude just that. The brand ethos is  simplicity and their aesthetic is what they call ‘minimal luxury’. The birch identity had to be inspired from the brands contemporary approach to design and modernistic techniques that they use to deliver a flawless fit customized to the very ‘T’.
Their signature style is crisp & clean minimalism with a hint of refined elegance that comes from seamless and rich yarns that they weave into shirts with perfect construction.
