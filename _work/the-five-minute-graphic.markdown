Another one of my design shenanigans. ' The five minute Graphic ' is a little experiment done to further hone my graphic style, time skill & design spontaneity. I timed myself for 5 minutes and put up whatever I have achieved at the end of it. I found the imperfections are where the beauty lies ! A true blue mixed media project.
